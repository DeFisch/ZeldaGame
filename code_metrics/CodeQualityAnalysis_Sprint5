CA1822: Member ‘CheatCodeCheck’ does not access instance data and can be marked as static
-	Fixed
IDE0044: Make field readonly (multiple occurrences)
-	Fixed
-	Exception: ItemSpriteFactory.pos is modified later on in the class
IDE0090: ‘new’ expression can be simplified (multiple occurrences)
-	All fixed
-	Specification that doesn’t require type specification if the constructor already knows the type
IDE0066: Use switch expression
-	Suppressed, because it doesn’t make sense to refactor and in my opinion the switch statement is more clear than the expression.
IDE0017: Use object initializer, on BlendState object in Game1.cs
-	Fixed
