Comments: I like that the additions to the Heart and Heart Container were done in single line statements and were easy to read. 
However, a potential weakness is having the health in the "Globals" section and not implemented in an easier
manner like just a static variable in the Player class or something passed in - it makes it a little bit terse to read. Nice work by connecting a lot of different
classes and areas together in a way that decreased coupling a lot and was easy to read!
