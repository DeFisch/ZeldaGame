Comments: As I said last sprint, a big strength of code for you is your simplicity and length. The classes are readable and organized and
were easy for me to go back and edit when I was trying to implement the hearts. When it comes to readability, however, you do tend to have a lot
of lines that I feel could be condensed or not necessary, typically in declaration. Sometimes it is a necessary evil, but I do think there are ways
you could have avoided it in a couple repetitive declaration sequences in the HUD classes. Otherwise, you did an excellent job and it was very easy and
clear reading your code (and made it maintainable too).
