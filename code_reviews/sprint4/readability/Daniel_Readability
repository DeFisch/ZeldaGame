Comments: This is a great and really readable class! All of the variable names and method names have appropriate
naming conventions. In addition, all the lines are as concise and clean as possible. There is an appropriate level
of iterative complexity in loops. Important variables are clean and abstracted neatly. The class is a little bit long, but
it is understandable since there's a lot of information for the loading of audio based on the platform/OS. Overall
great readability!
