Really maintainable and great code! There's relatively low coupling throughout this class and all the methods are as short/efficient as possible. 
Using the "=>" operator on several of the methods really makes them clear, concise, and easy to understand and maintain. 
The class as a whole is very cohesive and useful for only one of the two HUDs, performing exactly what it needs to and nothing more or less. 
In addition, the code is clean and well-organized, which makes it easy to both maintain and read.
