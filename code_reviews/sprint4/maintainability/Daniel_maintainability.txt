Name of the .cs file being reviewed: CollisionHandler.cs, GameState classes, Enemy classes

Number of minutes taken for the review: 15 mins
Comments: The CollisionHandler that the two of us worked on I would deem as well organized in different methods and very maintainable; maybe some
of the better maintainability we have in our code. The class is long, but that is a necessary evil, because you did an excellent job of refactoring all
the collision code into that class. This all made it easy to locate collision detection and quick to narrow down where a change needed to be made. Similar
things can be said about teh Game State classes, but not too much maintainability was needed because they were short and effective classes. However, once
we got to the collision methods, some of the logic got confusing in a bunch of if statements here and there, and they grew to be quite long, possibly making them
more buggy. I'm not sure if there was a way around this, or maybe break them up into different methods, but I struggled to deal with a couple collision changes.
Otherwise, your code is amazing, I was able to do what I needed with enemies almost as if I had wrote the classes because they were that well organized and created.
Great work!
