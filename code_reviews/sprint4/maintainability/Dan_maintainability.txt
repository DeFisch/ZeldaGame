Specific comments:
Overall the knockbacks and heart display code are pretty well written and takes little efforts to maintain in the future. The only thing I can see is the knockbacks of the enemies are scattered across 10 different classes, which will make future maintainance a bit more difficult. However, this is due the poor design of the enemy classes but not because of Dan's code. So overall I would say Dan did a 10/10 job on sprint4.
