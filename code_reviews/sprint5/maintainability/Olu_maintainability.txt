Comments: 
The addition of the white sword element is very maintainable as it follows the structure of previous codes for an addition of an item/weapon. This makes it easier to address any bugs as it follows a pattern. In terms of the globalized scale, it makes the code simple to maintain as it eliminates the passing of a scale to parameters for classes. It gives all the classes access to utilize the scale. Overall, most of the code were refactored well to make it maintainable for future changes.
