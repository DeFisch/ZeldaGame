All of the methods in the class are very cleanly abstracted into short methods that are concise and well-written. Great use of low coupling by only incorporating
two other types to be passed into the constructor, both of which are unique Map and HUD-specific classes and contribute directly to the HUD map. In addition,
there's high cohesion in the methods and how they impact solely the HUD Map and its teleportation functions. For greater conciseness, maybe the SetSelection method
and the Teleport method/CycleList method could be combined, which would be very easy with this implementation. This is great code!
