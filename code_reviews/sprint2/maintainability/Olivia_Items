Number of minutes taken for the review: 15 mins
Comments: The items looked tedious to make, and in some cases the IsPlaying variable was never used, which makes me question if it was necessary for all the files.
          For the ItemSpriteFactory, I would have declared the list as a list of ISprites, as you did, but you could've had it initialized with all your items, for
          example List<ISprite> { new x(), new y()... }. This way if you are to add a new sprite, you only have to add one additional piece, rather than declaring it,
          then setting it equal to an object, then adding it. That is just a preference, though, and it is otherwise maintainable for the switching of items.
