Maintainability Code Review

- Very low coupling. Everything utilizes objects in different, separate classes and the methods that are part of those classes. 
- High cohesion as well. All related objects and methods are tightly cohesive within the Player folder and even more specifically the Player Weapons folder.
- I initially wasnâ€™t favoring the foreach groups, as they allow for less flexibility if you want to directly modify an object in the collection, 
but they work really well here since you utilize methods from other classes to change the objects. 
- Overall great maintainability: this class is well-written and easy to modify for future refactoring.
