-	Naming conventions looks mostly consistent, I saw only one instance where CamelCase wasn’t used (using underscores instead of capital letters for distinction.)
-	The AddNPCs() function is a readable/clean way to add all of the different NPCs in.
-	No comments, but I think it’s fine because all of your code is easy to understand. 
The only thing that I might explain is some of the variables in cycleList() and how you're cycling through the List.
-	Overall, nicely readable code.
