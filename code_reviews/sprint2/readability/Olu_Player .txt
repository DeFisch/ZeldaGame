Comments:
All of the parts have concise, meaningful names. Relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations of elements are clear and intuitive. 

For AttackDown/Left/Right/UpSprite classes, not quiet sure how the timesLooped is used. Only AttackUpSprite checks the timesLooped value to pause the AttackUpSprite. Others do not really use the timesLooped.
