Specific Comments:
Generally the player weapon sprites classes follow a consistent design pattern of having short and simple classes/functions and a good naming strategy. Thanks to that, the code in the Player Weapons folder is very intuitive.
In the WeaponHandler class however, the choice of not immediately removing the projectile upon calling ProjectileExpiration is quite puzzling, rather it's saved in a list called expiredProjectiles where the usage of having such a list is not immediately obvious.
