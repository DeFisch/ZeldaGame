Comments: The different types of items class are clearly defined in the ItemSpriteFactory. To simplify this, I would recommend initializing the item classes while adding to the object list instead of creating a field for every item class. It looks like your item animation is being done in the draw method. I would recommend using your update method to handle the animation to make it easy to read. Overall, nice and easy to follow code. Nice work!
