Sprint number: 2
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: EnemyProjectileFactory.cs, EnemyFactory.cs, a few projectile sprite files
Author of the .cs files being reviewed: Daniel Feng
Number of minutes taken for the review: 20 mins
Comments: You do a great job of splitting up your Update() function as apposed to mine when it comes to updating the projectile animation / duration in your enemy projectile sprite files,
          as well as had incredible abstraction in your factories. I did find, however, that it made a couple files have a lot of methods, switch case statements, and several method parameters.
          An example would be in the Goriya sprite file, there was a lot of information to take in and had 100+ lines of compact code. Possibly breaking up into more classes to avoid 
          bulky code in one file, possibly even have it be reusable somewhere else. Other than those couple cases, it looks great, maintanable too, and inspired me to use a couple strategies
          you used for future sprints.
