MapHandler:
The method names are all clear based on what they do. For the "DrawWallOnHole" method, I am not sure how you got the decimal values? Are they exact values based on the screen size? One idea to increase readability is to simplify the fractions into fractional form (eg. 0.25 -> 1 / 4). I am more used to working with camelCase / PascalCase naming convention for method names, but besides this nitpick, it all looks fine.

MapLoader:
Looks good to me.

MapStaticRectangles:
Same issue with random-looking decimal values  with MapHandler (i get that this is kinda unavoidable tho =/ )

Content.map_data
Looks good to me.

CollisionHandler:
Same as MapStaticRectangles.
