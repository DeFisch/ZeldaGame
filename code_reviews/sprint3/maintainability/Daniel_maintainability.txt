Comments: Starting with your collision implementation, I think the agreed upon refactoring for returning hitboxes was smart and worked extremely well. Not to mention your implementation for the player colliding. I struggled on some aspects and you found smart and efficient solutions for making the game more playable. The methods were short, and easy to use when needed for collision. The collision code is extremely maintainable, I would critique a little readibility on some aspects of the player collision and the map classes, but this is maintainability which I believe you nailed in terms of collision. For the map classes, they work extremely well and I won't pretend like I know 100% how they work, but in certain areas, you have a lot of things happening in one method. I would recommend breaking them up, or at least break up longer methods in the future, because this could cause bugs if you aren't careful, as well as having difficulty trying to fix a bug in a big complicated method. We talked in class of how we want methods to do as little as possible, which can make bug fixing easier and make your code more maintainable, so that would be my biggest recommendation. Other than that, everything has been amazing.
