Comments: Good use of private variables and encapsulation. 
Methods are short and concise, and get the complex workings done well while 
still being readable and not too long. Additionally, the "pushDirection" method is
really nicely done; it's very usable and maintainable. Making the 
different states as methods was a good option in this case. Overall
great code!
