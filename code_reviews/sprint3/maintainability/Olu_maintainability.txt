Comments: Code to add and remove a decorated is easy to maintain as its just the player sprite with its color changed for some time after taking a hit from projectiles/enemies. Great approach to adding this functionality. Also great job and thanks for refactoring the majority of the .cs files to be easy to read and maintain and also to have a universal scale.
